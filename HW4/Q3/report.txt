SECTION B

1. The result for Weka is 97.0717 % and is comparable to my model accuracy which varies between 96-98%. The results are similar since my model builds a random forest of 10 trees using bootstrapping while we apply 10 fold cross validation in Weka, both essentially the same technique.

2. I chose the Logistic regression classifier whose algorithm goes this way,

step 1: Assign an initial value to each coefficient and calculate probability of first training instance that belongs to class 0.
prediction = 1 / (1 + e^(-(b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2)))

step 2: Calculate new coefficients using simple update equation: bÊ= bÊ+ alpha * (y Ð prediction) * prediction * (1 Ð prediction) * x, where alpha is learning rate.

step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each training instance in the dataset and update model accordingly.
